# Breast Cancer Classifier (Deep Learning) 
This code helps you classify malignant and benign tumors using Deep Learning.
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

### Description
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Deep learning models are loosely related to information processing and communication patterns in a biological nervous system, such as neural coding that attempts to define a relationship between various stimuli and associated neuronal responses in the brain.

### Python  Implementation

1) Dataset- UCI-ML
2) I have used 30 features to classify
3) Instead of 0=benign and 1=malignant, I have used 1=benign and 2=malignant


### Execution
To run the code, type `python B_Cancer_DL.py`

```
python B_Cancer_DL.py
```
